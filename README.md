# Feature-Based Image Alignment & Panorama Generation Project - Intro to Computer Graphics Course
This project implements a classical feature-based image alignment & panorama generation pipeline in Python, developed as part of the *"Introduction to Graphics, Image Processing & Computer Vision"* course at TAU’s School of Computer Science (2025–2026), during the final year of our studies. The goal of the project is to construct panoramic images from a sequence of overlapping frames obtained from a video, by estimating geometric transformations directly from image content. The pipeline was implemented from scratch, covering feature detection, descriptor construction, robust matching, geometric estimation, and backward image warping.
